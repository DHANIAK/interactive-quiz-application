 **Project Overview:**

The **Quiz Application** is an interactive web-based app developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, built and managed in **Visual Studio Code**. It allows users to take a multiple-choice quiz, receive **instant feedback**, and view their **final score** upon completion. The app dynamically loads questions and provides a polished user interface with responsive design.

**Core Features:**

1. **Dynamic Question Loading**

* Questions and answers are stored in a JavaScript object/array.
* Questions are rendered dynamically to the page.
* Only one question is visible at a time.

 2. **Instant Feedback**

* When a user selects an answer, immediate feedback is provided:

  * Correct answer highlights green.
  * Incorrect answer highlights red and shows the correct one.
* Feedback is shown before moving to the next question.

 3. **Scoring System**

* Score is calculated in real-time as users answer questions.
* Final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
* Option to restart the quiz is available.

4. **Polished User Interface**

* Built using CSS for a clean, modern look.
* Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
* Button hover effects, progress indicators, and visual feedback.

 **How It Works:**

1. When the page loads, the quiz starts from the first question.
2. Each question is fetched from a pre-defined question list.
3. Users select one of the multiple-choice options.
4. The app:

   * Validates the answer
   * Displays instant feedback
   * Updates the score if the answer is correct
5. After all questions are answered, the app displays the final score with a restart option.
